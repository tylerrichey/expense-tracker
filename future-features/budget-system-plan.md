# Budget System Implementation Plan

## Overview

This document outlines the comprehensive plan for implementing a flexible budget system in the Expense Tracker application. The system will support recurring budgets with historical tracking, active budget management, and vacation mode functionality.

## Requirements Analysis

### Core Requirements

1. **Flexible Budget Cycles**
   - Start on any weekday (Monday-Sunday)
   - Duration: 7-28 days minimum/maximum
   - Automatic recurring cycles (e.g., every Monday for 7 days = Monday to Sunday)

2. **Historical Budget Integrity**
   - Previous budget data must remain intact when budgets change
   - Expenses should always reflect against the budget that was active at the time
   - No retroactive budget changes

3. **Active Budget Management**
   - Edit current/active budget amounts only
   - Cannot edit past budget periods
   - Clear distinction between active and historical budgets

4. **Future Budget Planning**
   - "Upcoming budget" concept
   - Set next budget without affecting current one
   - Seamless transition when current budget period ends
   - **Auto-continuation**: If no upcoming budget is set, current budget automatically continues with same parameters

5. **Retroactive Budget Creation**
   - Allow budget creation to apply retroactively when no current budget exists
   - Example: On Wednesday, create Monday-Sunday budget that applies to current Monday
   - Retroactive periods automatically associate existing expenses from that timeframe

6. **Vacation Mode**
   - Temporarily disable budget tracking
   - Revert to simple expense logging
   - Easy toggle on/off

### Business Logic

#### Budget Periods
- Each budget creates recurring periods (e.g., Mon-Sun weekly)
- Each period has start_date, end_date, target_amount
- Expenses are associated with periods based on timestamp
- Historical periods are immutable once completed

#### Auto-Continuation Logic
- When active budget period ends and no upcoming budget exists:
  - Automatically create next period with same budget parameters
  - Seamless continuation without user intervention
  - Maintains budget tracking continuity

#### Retroactive Budget Creation
- When no active budget exists, allow retroactive period creation:
  - Calculate what the period start date would be based on weekday + duration
  - If calculated start date is in the past, create period retroactively
  - Automatically associate existing expenses from that timeframe with new period
  - Example: Today is Wednesday, user creates Monday-Sunday budget → period starts last Monday

#### Budget States
- **Draft**: Created but not yet active
- **Active**: Currently running budget period
- **Scheduled**: Upcoming budget waiting to start
- **Completed**: Past budget period
- **Paused**: Vacation mode - no budget tracking

## Database Schema Design

### New Tables

#### `budgets` Table
```sql
CREATE TABLE budgets (
  id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
  name TEXT NOT NULL,                    -- User-friendly name
  amount DECIMAL(10,2) NOT NULL,         -- Target amount
  start_weekday INTEGER NOT NULL,        -- 0=Sunday, 1=Monday, etc.
  duration_days INTEGER NOT NULL,        -- 7-28 days
  created_at DATETIME DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
  updated_at DATETIME DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
  is_active BOOLEAN DEFAULT false,       -- Currently active budget
  is_upcoming BOOLEAN DEFAULT false,     -- Scheduled next budget
  vacation_mode BOOLEAN DEFAULT false    -- Paused state
);
```

#### `budget_periods` Table
```sql
CREATE TABLE budget_periods (
  id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
  budget_id INTEGER NOT NULL,
  start_date DATE NOT NULL,
  end_date DATE NOT NULL,
  target_amount DECIMAL(10,2) NOT NULL,  -- Snapshot of budget amount
  actual_spent DECIMAL(10,2) DEFAULT 0,  -- Calculated field
  status TEXT DEFAULT 'upcoming',        -- upcoming, active, completed
  created_at DATETIME DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
  FOREIGN KEY (budget_id) REFERENCES budgets(id) ON DELETE CASCADE
);
```

### Schema Modifications

#### `expenses` Table Enhancement
```sql
-- Add budget period association
ALTER TABLE expenses ADD COLUMN budget_period_id INTEGER;
ALTER TABLE expenses ADD FOREIGN KEY (budget_period_id) REFERENCES budget_periods(id);
```

## API Endpoints Design

### Budget Management
- `GET /api/budgets` - List all budgets with current status
- `POST /api/budgets` - Create new budget (with retroactive period creation if no active budget)
- `PUT /api/budgets/:id` - Update active budget (target amount only)
- `DELETE /api/budgets/:id` - Delete budget (if no expenses associated)
- `POST /api/budgets/:id/activate` - Set as active budget
- `POST /api/budgets/:id/schedule` - Set as upcoming budget
- `POST /api/budgets/vacation-mode` - Toggle vacation mode
- `POST /api/budgets/auto-continue` - Manually trigger auto-continuation of current budget

### Budget Periods
- `GET /api/budget-periods` - List periods with spending data
- `GET /api/budget-periods/:id` - Get specific period details
- `GET /api/budget-periods/current` - Get active period with progress

### Analytics
- `GET /api/budget-analytics/current` - Current period progress
- `GET /api/budget-analytics/history` - Historical budget performance
- `GET /api/budget-analytics/trends` - Spending trends across periods

## UI/UX Component Design

### New Components

#### 1. Budget Dashboard (`BudgetDashboard.vue`)
- Current budget progress (circular progress indicator)
- Remaining amount and days
- Quick stats (daily average, projection)
- Vacation mode toggle

#### 2. Budget Manager (`BudgetManager.vue`)
- List of all budgets (active, upcoming, historical)
- Create/edit budget forms
- Budget activation controls

#### 3. Budget Form (`BudgetForm.vue`)
- Amount input
- Start weekday selector
- Duration selector (7-28 days)
- Name/description field

#### 4. Budget History (`BudgetHistory.vue`)
- Historical budget periods
- Performance comparisons
- Trend visualizations

#### 5. Budget Settings (`BudgetSettings.vue`)
- Vacation mode controls
- Notification preferences
- Default budget templates

### Enhanced Components

#### Expense List Enhancement
- Show budget period context for each expense
- Visual indicators for over-budget periods
- Filter by budget period

#### Dashboard Enhancement
- Budget progress prominently displayed
- Quick budget vs actual spending comparison
- Alert indicators for budget overruns

## Technical Considerations

### Data Integrity
- Use database transactions for budget period transitions
- Implement proper foreign key constraints
- Add data validation at API and database levels

### Performance
- Index budget_periods by date ranges for efficient queries
- Cache current budget period data
- Optimize analytics queries with proper indexing

### User Experience
- Clear visual feedback for budget states
- Intuitive budget creation wizard
- Graceful handling of edge cases (overlapping periods, etc.)

### Error Handling
- Handle budget period overlaps
- Manage timezone considerations
- Validate budget constraints (7-28 days, positive amounts)
- Handle retroactive period edge cases (very old start dates)
- Manage auto-continuation during system downtime

### Budget Logic Considerations
- **Retroactive Period Calculation**: Calculate proper start date based on current date, target weekday, and duration
- **Expense Backfill**: Efficiently associate existing expenses with newly created retroactive periods
- **Auto-Continuation**: Background job or trigger to create next period when current ends
- **Conflict Resolution**: Prevent overlapping periods when retroactive creation might conflict with existing data

## Migration Strategy

### Database Migration
1. Create new tables with proper constraints
2. Add foreign key column to expenses table
3. Backfill existing expenses with null budget_period_id
4. Create indexes for performance

### User Experience Migration
1. Show budget features as "new" to existing users
2. Provide guided tour for budget setup
3. Maintain backward compatibility for non-budget users

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests
- Budget period calculation logic
- Expense-to-period association
- Budget state transitions

### Integration Tests
- API endpoint functionality
- Database constraint enforcement
- Budget period overlap handling

### User Testing
- Budget creation workflow
- Mobile budget management
- Edge case scenarios

## Future Enhancements

### Potential Features (Post-MVP)
- Multiple simultaneous budgets (categories)
- Budget sharing/collaboration
- Advanced analytics and ML insights
- Integration with financial institutions
- Automated budget adjustments based on spending patterns
- Budget templates and presets
- Goal-based budgeting (savings targets)

## Success Metrics

### Technical Metrics

- Zero data loss during budget transitions
- 100% test coverage for budget logic

### User Metrics
- Budget setup completion rate > 80%
- Daily active usage of budget features > 60%
