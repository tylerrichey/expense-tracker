## Location & Pattern Analysis
- **Spending heatmap** - Geographic visualization of where money is spent
- **Distance traveled for expenses** - Track how far you travel to make purchases
- **"Usual suspects"** - Most frequently visited places

- **Home vs away spending** - Compare spending near home vs while traveling

## Financial Insights
- **Spending velocity** - Rate of spending increase/decrease over time
- **"Expensive day" alerts** - Identify days significantly above average spending
- **Budget variance tracking** - Compare actual vs budgeted spending
- **Spending distribution** - Histogram showing distribution of expense amounts
- **Rolling averages** - 7-day, 30-day moving averages for trend analysis

## Behavioral Patterns
- **Spending consistency score** - Measure how consistent spending habits are

- **Location loyalty scoring** - Measure frequency of visits to specific places
- **Spending efficiency** - Cost per mile traveled or per location visited

## Advanced Analytics
